# plan2event-cover-v2

**Live:** https://plan2event-cover-v2.cycls.ai

Attach a venue DXF and describe an event. You get the same DXF back with the
event laid out in it — stages, tents, toilets, food, generators, fences — as
real CAD blocks at real metric coordinates, on their own `EVENT-*` layers so
the client's drawing is never touched.

This repository is **one agent**: the **Cover** placement engine,
**v2** variant.

## How it places things

Coverage siting, checked by crowd simulation. Toilets, water and first aid are placed with pysal/spopt location-allocation (LSCP / MCLP) so that nobody walks too far to reach one; everything else is placed greedily. The result is then checked with a jupedsim crowd-egress simulation, which finds layouts that fence people in — something no bounding-box check can see.

Method after pysal/spopt (BSD-3) and PedestrianDynamics/jupedsim. Measured on a real 7.5 MB venue masterplan with a
25-item programme: **25/25 placed, 0 violations, 9.2 s**.

## v2

Everything v1 does, plus four things. The model reads two reference files shipped in `reference/` — provisioning figures from FEMA IS-15 and site-design rules. It follows composition rules in the prompt. It must cite a source for every regulatory number or say it assumed it. And it may never draw an object in place of a catalogue block. Then, after it stops, the plan is rendered beside the venue as supplied, reviewed as an event-operations professional would, and revised — twice.

The v1 of this engine is [plan2event-cover](https://github.com/Eli-AMAR/plan2event-cover).

## The idea every engine shares

**The model never chooses coordinates.** It decides what the event needs and
how the pieces relate; the engine decides where, choosing only from positions
already proved to fit against the real free-space polygon of the drawing.
Holodeck, LayoutVLM, DirectLayout and I-Design all split the work this way. The
agent it replaces, [agent-2d-to-2d-not](https://github.com/Eli-AMAR/agent-2d-to-2d-not),
did the opposite: it asked an image model to imagine the finished site and read
positions back off the picture.

## Layout

```
agent.py         the agent — deploys exactly this one
core/            DXF reading, free space, the catalogue, placement, the tool
                 surface, the prompt, the model driver
engines/cover.py   the placement method
reference/       two files the v2 prompt tells the model to read
assets/          the catalogue: 3 650 usable blocks, normalised to metres
tools/           harness.py, and the scripts that built the catalogue
docs/            transcript.md — the full conversation that built this
CLAUDE.md        the handover: decisions, and the bugs each one cost
```

## Run it

Python 3.12.

```bash
pip install ezdxf "shapely>=2.0" numpy scipy matplotlib spopt geopandas pulp jupedsim
python tools/make_site.py            # writes a synthetic 120 x 90 m venue
python tools/harness.py              # or: python tools/harness.py your_venue.dxf
```

The harness places a fixed programme with this engine, validates it and writes
`harness_cover.png` next to the plan. No model, no deployment, no keys — and
with `make_site.py`, no client drawing either.

## Deploy it

```bash
pip install cycls==0.0.2.140
cp .env.example .env        # fill in the three keys
python agent.py deploy
```

`.env` needs `CYCLS_API_KEY`, `FAL_KEY` (image hosting for the renders shown in
the chat) and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (from `claude setup-token`).
**Leave `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` empty.** The model runs through the Claude Code CLI
on a subscription; if the API key is present the CLI silently prefers it and
bills per token.

## Why it is built this way

Read `CLAUDE.md` for the state of the work and the traps already paid for —
negative site coordinates that made a solver silently infeasible, a unit
header nobody was reading, an inches-to-feet conversion factor. Read
`docs/transcript.md` for the conversation in which each of those was found.
